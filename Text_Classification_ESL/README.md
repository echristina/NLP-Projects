 * Ensure that your working directory contains the following directories and files.  - data / lang-8.zip
      - data / asian_cities.txt
      - data / asian_culture.txt
      - data / asian_food.txt
      - data / dev.txt
      - data / european_cities.txt
      - data/ european_culture.txt
      - data/ european_food.txt 
      - data / irreg_pp.txt
      - data / test.txt
      - data / testfile.txt
      - data / train.txt

* Additionally, (optional) you may have data/lang-8/*.html files, which are the content of the lang-8.zip.
* The program is capable of reading html input files either in the zip file or as uncompressed files in the lang-8 directory. This is controlled by the optional parameter mode in the get_raw_data function.
