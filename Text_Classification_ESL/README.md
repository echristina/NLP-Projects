# Classification of Texts written by ESL students 

### Problem Statement
This project creates an end-to-end classification system using a corpus of HTML documents scrapped from the Lang-8 language learning website. We build a classifier to distinguish English text written by Lang-8 users whose native language (L1) is another European language (French and Spanish) from those written by L1 speakers of East Asian languages (Japanese, Korean, and Mandarin Chinese).
